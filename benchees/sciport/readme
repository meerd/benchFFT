==== readme for scilib =====

This directory contains software for the SCIPORT package.  SCIPORT is
a portable FORTRAN emulation of CRAY SCILIB, a library of scientific
applications subprograms developed by Cray Research, Inc. for use with
its CRAY supercomputers.  SCIPORT was developed by the Information
System Operation of Corporate Research and Development to enhance
convertibility between local computers and CRAY supercomputers.  Due
to its portability, SCIPORT allows development of applications
software on almost any computer with desirable software development
tools (e.g. IBM, VAX, SUN workstations).  The SCILIB-type calls of
SCIPORT then allow the use of the CRAY supercomputer for production
runs with no required changes in the applications software.  SCIPORT
also provides a useful library of mathematical utilities for
applications which do not require the use of a CRAY supercomputer.

The SCIPORT tape (available from S. Lamson, Dialcomm 8*833-5795)
contains single and double precision FORTRAN files, data files for
testing, and a help file.  The FORTRAN files are used to create two
object libraries, SCIPORTS for single precision and SCIPORTD for
double precision, and executable images for the testing procedures.
The data files contain test data with SCILIB results to be compared
with the SCIPORT results obtained during the execution of the testing
procedures.  The help file is used to create the on-line VMS help
library or UNIX man pages to be used in conjunction with SCIPORT.
